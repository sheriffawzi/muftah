== Description ==

Enables full support for the Co-Authors Plus plugin in Genesis. 

You need to have the [Co-Authors Plus](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/co-authors-plus/) plugin installed for this plugin to work properly. The Co-Authors plugin allows you to add more than one author to a particular post. 

The Genesis framework has an in-built function to display an author box, and the Genesis Co-Authors plugin enables 
the Genesis author box to detect co-authors and display them in additional author boxes.

With this setup, you can create guest authors without creating a user profile for them, just create a 'Guest Author' via the Co-Authors Plus plugin, and include that guest author in your post. Genesis Co-Authors Plus will then take care of displaying the guest author/s on the front end.

To enable the Genesis author box please follow the [instructions on this website](http://slickwp.com/add-author-box-genesis-blog/).
